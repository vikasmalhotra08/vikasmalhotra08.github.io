I am an engineer at hear. I have always wanted to start a blog with my thoughts on various forms of ML engineering and data science in general. I have hesitated so far because of so many reasons. But, here goes nothing, starting my personal blog on various topics. 

I am interested in consolidating the knowledge that I gain as part of my wanderings through various blog posts, papers, code repos and my contribution as well. 

The comments on this site are my own, none of my employers endorses these comments and thoughts. 

Jotting down the list of topics that I hope to cover while I ramble about various topics under the sun. 

### NLP:

Here, I intend to talk about my experiments with various NLP and NLU algorithms and their industry applications. For me, it made sense to bring out the usage of NLU algorithms and its applications and how I see these been built in future. 

1. Word2Vec and its usage in predicting the next item in your basket in an e-commerce setting. 
2. ParlAI: What is it, how to build a dialogue model and my experience in deploying it as a bot. 

### CV:

Here, I am interested in exploring the blazzing pace that has been set in CV world with all the YOLO's and EfficientDet's been released to one-up each other. I will explore all these algo's, its implementations and my own implementation on my GPU's. 

1. Why Detectron2 for object detection?


### ML Engineering:

1. Training Yolo5 on two 1080 TI's 
2. Why we should think about using Horovod for parallel training tasks? 

### Papers:

1. Deep Neural Networks for YouTube Recommendations: https://research.google/pubs/pub45530/

### ML Engineering System Design:

1. How to think about System design and some important components of a ML system?
